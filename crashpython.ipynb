There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results. Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.\n",

An `integer` is a whole number, without a fraction, while a `float` is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a `TypeError`.

    "A while loop will continuously execute code depending on the value of a condition. It begins with the keyword `while`, followed by a comparison to be evaluated, then a colon. On the next line is the code block to be executed, indented to the right. Similar to an `if` statement, the code in the body will only be executed if the comparison is evaluated to be true. What sets a `while` loop apart, however, is that this code block will keep executing as long as the evaluation statement is true. Once the statement is no longer true, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed.\n",

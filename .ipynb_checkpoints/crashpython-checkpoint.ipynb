There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results. Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.\n",

An `integer` is a whole number, without a fraction, while a `float` is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a `TypeError`.

You'll also learn to use for loops to iterate over data, and how to use the `range()` function with for loops. You'll also explore common errors when using for loops and how to fix them."
